GPT 4 is the best.

It is painful to use something which is not best, because any error results in huge amount of manual testing and debugging. It is opposite to what we want.

GPT sometimes suggests another approach: I wanted to re-create the level form scratch, but it caused issue and GPT suggested to not re-create all the objects and roll back their state instead.
