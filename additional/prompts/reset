I have a browser-based game written in JavaScript and MatterJS.
User adds some ground (static polygons) and stones (non-static polygons). Then simulation is started, stones starts falling and either hit or not the target.
The simulation starts by pressing the readyButton.

What I want is to add a resetButton which stops the simulation. It should re-create the matterJS engine instance and add all the bodies back to the world.
There is some incomplete implementation, because it creates duplicates for objects where are loaded initially and not added by user. There is the Polygon.userAdded field, but the implementation is incomplete
