I have written a browser-based game written in JavaScript using the matter.js library.
After clicking the readyButton ('Start') button simulation is run.
There is an ability to pass the level JSON name as a parameter, e.g. http://localhost:8080/?level=2.json
I want to rename the index.html to game html, and I want to have another index.html.
In that new index.html should be a list of levels and an iframe which displays the current level.
At the left there should be list of levels and clicking on any of the items of the list should reload the game in the iframe with the corresponding ?level parameter.
The list of the levels should be taken from a JSON path to which is passed via gameset param, e.g. http://localhost:8080/?gameset=level.json
